            <p>Hi, my name is Arun Mistry, and I am a Mechatronics Engineering II Student in McMaster Univeristy. I am in my second year, and plan on graduating in 2023-24. My ambition is to work in the field of robotics. Robotics involves building, coding, debugging, problem solving, and a lot more, all of which I find very interesting.</p>
            <p>Some of my hobbies include cooking, coding, going for long walks, playing games on my PC and tinkering around with my phone's software (Pocophone F1). Some of my favourite memories during university were during various events. Meeting new people, learning new things and being in different scenarios in different environments was always interesting.</p>
